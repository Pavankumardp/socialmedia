<p>LinkedIn has outlined its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/linkedin-pages/new-features">latest batch of updates for Company Pages</a>, most of which had already been previewed in some capacity, but are now being rolled out on a broader basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First off, LinkedIn’s making its new post templates available to all company pages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can see in these examples, LinkedIn’s post templates, as they sound, provide a range of visual enhancements for your LinkedIn updates, which could help to make them stand out in feeds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LinkedIn originally launched post templates for individual users&nbsp;<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedin-adds-new-templates-for-posts-to-facilitate-more-creative-updates/629562/">last month</a>, but now, it’s making them available for Company Page updates as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As per&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/linkedin-pages/new-features">LinkedIn</a>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“</em><em>Create engaging, actionable LinkedIn content easier than ever with customizable templates, available directly in the LinkedIn app, with no third-party tools required.”</em></p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mean, I don’t know that these types of posts really fit with LinkedIn’s professional approach. But then again, as many have noted, LinkedIn is increasingly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/06/21/linkedin-became-new-facebook/">becoming more like Facebook anyway</a>, with more personal posts and updates that are less focused on professional aspects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that seems to be working – LinkedIn’s parent company Microsoft keeps reporting ‘<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedin-continues-to-see-record-levels-of-engagement-and-sessions-growth/628203/">record levels of engagement</a>’ in the app every quarter, so maybe this is actually a good, valuable addition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ll see how people feel about it when every other LinkedIn ‘thinkfluencer’ is posting using these templates. You can access post templates in the mobile app by tapping the ‘<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a791951?trk=lms-blog-liproduct&amp;src=bl-po" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use template</a>’ option in the post composer menu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an addition to this,&nbsp;LinkedIn’s also making its new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedin-adds-new-link-sticker-option-to-help-drive-more-traffic-from-your/628956/">link stickers</a>&nbsp;available for Company Pages too, which could help to drive more direct response to your updates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On another front, LinkedIn will also now enable all Company Pages to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedin-rolls-out-option-to-pin-comments-in-reply-chains/630659/">pin comments beneath their brand posts</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rollout for this feature also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/linkedin-rolls-out-option-to-pin-comments-in-reply-chains/630659/">started last month</a>, with some users seeing the option to pin comments in the app.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That could be a good way to spark more focused engagement, and highlight top fans, while you could also use this to simply boost interactions by pinning the comment with the most engagement at the top of the reply chain. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a reminder, LinkedIn Company Pages can also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a547158">pin an update</a>&nbsp;for similar purpose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, LinkedIn has also added a new&nbsp;‘<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a772302?trk=lms-blog-liproduct&amp;src=bl-po">Our featured commitments</a>’ section for Company Pages, where brands will be able to showcase their most important values.</p>

<p><em>“Increasingly in today’s market, job seekers are evaluating potential employers based on their values. They’re interested in knowing where companies stand on issues that are important to them, such as DEI, work-life balance, sustainability, etc. To provide greater insight and connections, LinkedIn is enabling employers to highlight these commitments on their LinkedIn company page to define their talent brand and values.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brands will be able to&nbsp;include up to five commitments in their featured commitments section, while you’ll also be able to host content that demonstrates the same, all of which will be displayed in a sub-panel in the ‘About’ section of your Page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are some potentially handy updates, with the link stickers and pinned comments standing out as likely the most valuable additions for LinkedIn page managers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post templates I’m not as sold on, especially for brands – but then again, there may be ways to use these templates to improve the presentation of your posts, and maybe, that’ll increase overall engagement.</p>
