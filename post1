<p>Instagram continues its gradual process of merging its video products into one, with the announcement that videos in Stories that are under 60 seconds in length will&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1573223477213122561">no longer be split into 15-second segments in the app</a>.</p>

<p>Last October, Instagram&nbsp;<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/instagram-retires-igtv-brand-merges-video-feed-posts-into-a-single-format/607711/">retired its IGTV brand</a>, as it combined&nbsp;IGTV and feed videos into one format, while in July, Instagram announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/instagram-will-now-feed-all-video-uploads-into-reels-adds-new-creative-too/627877/">all uploaded video under 15 minutes in length would be posted as Reels</a>, further aligning its various video formats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The merging of its video options is aimed at simplifying the app, while it will also, ideally, help Instagram maximize user engagement, by making all of its video content, in all formats, available in more places where users are interacting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By shifting its video content to a more aligned format, that’ll give IG more video inventory to insert into user feeds, which it’s increasingly looking to do via AI-defined recommendations, as it follows TikTok’s lead in making your main feed more focused on entertainment, as opposed to being restricted to only the latest posts from people and profiles that you follow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently noted that j<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/zuckerberg-says-that-meta-plans-to-double-the-amount-of-ai-recommended-cont/628312/">ust over 15% of the content in Instagram feeds</a>&nbsp;now comes from people, groups, or accounts that users don’t follow, with its AI recommendations contributing more and more to the user experience. Zuckerberg noted that he expects to see that amount more than double by the end of next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instagram’s been working towards this for some time, with Instagram chief Adam Mosseri&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238513/instagram-adam-mosseri-reels-decoder-interview-podcast">noting back in January</a>&nbsp;that:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>“We’re looking about how we can - not just with IGTV, but across all of Instagram - simplify and consolidate ideas, because last year we placed a lot of new bets. I think this year we have to go back to our focus on simplicity and craft.”</em></p>
